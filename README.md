# Cat and Mouse Game

This repository contains a Python implementation of a game that simulates the movement of two cats and a mouse on a line. The objective is to determine which cat will reach the mouse first, assuming the cats travel at equal speed and the mouse does not move. If the cats arrive at the same time, the mouse escapes while they fight.

## Implementation

The code is organized into the following files:

- **main.py**: Contains the main function that interacts with the user, prompts for input, and displays the results.
- **cat_mouse.py**: Implements the catAndMouse function, which calculates the outcome based on the positions of the cats and the mouse.
- **test_cat_mouse.py**: Includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the catAndMouse function.

## Getting Started

To run the code and play the Cat and Mouse game, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the game by executing the following command: `python main.py`
5. Enter the number of queries (1-100) when prompted.
6. Provide the positions of Cat A, Cat B, and Mouse C for each query.
7. The program will display the outcome for each query.

## Testing

The repository includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the `catAndMouse` function. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the tests by executing the following command: `python -m unittest`

I have uploaded the code to the GitHub repository. Here is the link: https://github.com/SeSartaj/task_aveta
